# 📘 Java Exercises and SQL – IT Class Compilation

## Description

This repository is a **personal compilation of Java programming exercises** and **SQL practice queries** completed during classroom sessions. It includes various Java source files demonstrating basic to intermediate-level concepts and a `notes.txt` file containing structured MySQL queries related to database creation, data manipulation, and relational joins.

This repository serves as a digital notebook and code archive for learning and revisiting core programming and database concepts.

## Java Content Includes

* 📊 `2ndTable.java`: Likely demonstrates 2D arrays or tabular display logic
* 🧮 `exer4.java`: A standalone Java exercise, possibly involving arithmetic or control structures
* ...and many more

*Note: Java file names imply hands-on exercises done in class rather than full applications.*

## SQL Content Includes

* ✅ Table creation statements for:

  * `students`
  * `subjects`
  * `enroll`
* 📥 Sample `INSERT` statements to populate tables
* 🔍 Complex `SELECT` queries with subqueries, filters, and aggregate functions
* 🎯 Practical examples of:

  * Foreign key relationships
  * Table joins
  * Data filtering using `IN`, `JOIN`, and nested queries

## Learning Highlights

* ✅ Java syntax and structure familiarity
* 🔄 Looping and conditional logic in Java
* 🗃️ Fundamentals of SQL schema design
* 🤝 Relational database concepts: keys, joins, and constraints
* 📊 Aggregate operations like `SUM()`
* 🧠 Subquery and derived table techniques

## Use Cases

* Review material for programming and database exams
* Jumpstart for small Java-MySQL integration projects
* Code snippets for beginners learning syntax and logic
